          1. Description of Services
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Kimih provides a marketplace that connects buyers with various beauty
          and wellness service providers in the UAE. Our platform enables
          service providers to list and offer their services, while buyers can
          search for, book, and review these services. Kimih does not charge
          businesses to join the platform. Instead, we charge a transaction fee
          of 5% on each successful booking processed through our platform. This
          fee is deducted from the payment made by the customer, and the
          remaining amount is transferred to the service provider.
